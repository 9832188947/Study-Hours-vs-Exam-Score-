### Overview
The project demonstrates the use of **Linear Regression** to predict exam scores. It uses a dataset where each record contains:
- `Hours_study`: Number of hours spent studying.
- `Exam_score`: Expected score in the exam.

By training a regression model on this data, the program can predict an exam score based on user input (study hours).
